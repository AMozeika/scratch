# Logos Collective Scratch

This directory contains various scratch work for individuals within the organization. It helps us keep things clean while also enabling collaborative work. 

It also helps with holding onto various work in the case that a core contributor leaves the orgnanization. 

It is the hope that each peice of work ends up finding a more permanent place within the organization once it has reached a level of stability.
